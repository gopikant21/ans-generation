It is defined as the probability of obtaining a test statistic at least as extreme as the one actually observed, assuming the null hypothesis is true. In other words, it answers the question: “If the null hypothesis were correct, how likely is it that we would see results like this (or more extreme) purely by random chance?\"\n",

This provides evidence in favor of the alternative hypothesis, leading researchers to reject the null. Conversely, a large p-value indicates that the observed data is consistent with the null hypothesis, and there is insufficient evidence to reject it. Importantly, the p-value does not measure the probability that the null hypothesis itself is true, nor does it indicate the size or practical importance of an effect — it only assesses the compatibility between the data and the null model.\"\n",
